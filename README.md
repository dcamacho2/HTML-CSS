HTML-CSS
===============
sites made with html and css and js!


##Airbnb site Redesign
This was a simple site made a while ago to learn the basics of html and css. I also went an extra step and used bootstrap for a more complex formating (convinced by coworkers to use, now I love it).

##First Website (very beginner level!)
This was the second website I built. I used the knowledge acquired from my first page, as well as other resources (bing, books, google, etc...) to build a more complex site. Simple as before, but this time I added media queries, multiple html and css files, and a one javascript script that at the time I did not know what it did or how it worked. The js was added because I wanted to see what it did haha, needless to say that that it was a terrible script to choose due to its complexity!

##Intro to JS and Jquery
After seeing the cool things that could be done with JS I decided to confront the language, and built this page as a "test"/intro page. It builds atop previous knowledge on html and css as well, but its very simple. Just a couple of functions to create a menu page.

##Mini news reader
Created a small news reader that has jquery event handlers to react when an area is clicked at which point something specific is done. Also added elements of menu learned earlier. The project is stylized using bootstrap and css
