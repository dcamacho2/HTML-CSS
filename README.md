HTML-CSS
===============
sites made with html and css and js!


##Airbnb site Redesign
This was a simple site made a while ago to learn the basics of html and css. I also went an extra step and used bootstrap for a more complex formating (convinced by coworkers to use, now I love it). 

##First Website (very beginner level!)
This was the second website I built. I used the knowledge acquired from my first page, as well as other resources (bing, books, google, etc...) to build a more complex site. Simple as before, but this time I added media queries, multiple html and css files, and a one javascript script that at the time I did not know what it did or how it worked. The js was added because I wanted to see what it did haha, needless to say that that it was a terrible script to choose due to its complexity!

##Intro to JS and Jquery
After seeing the cool things that could be done with JS I decided to confront the language, and built this page as a "test"/intro page. It builds atop previous knowledge on html and css as well, but its very simple. Just a couple of functions to create a menu page.
